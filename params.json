{"name":"npmjs.us","tagline":"Unofficial but pretty good US (east) mirror for npm: https://registry.npmjs.us","body":"### npmjs.us\r\n\r\nThis is an unofficial but pretty good US (east) mirror for npm; this service is sponsored and maintained by [norfolkjs.org](norfolkjs.org).\r\n\r\n### Using this service\r\n- Option 1: Add this registry to your `.npmrc`. e.g.\r\n\r\n        registry = https://registry.npmjs.us/public\r\n\r\n- Option 2: Set the registry config via `npm`\r\n\r\n        npm config set registry=https://registry.npmjs.us/public\r\n\r\n- Option 2: Add it as a command-line argument\r\n\r\n        npm install forever --registry https://registry.npmjs.us/public\r\n\r\n### Modus Operandi\r\nWe continuously replicate the official npmjs database. It is large (>200GB) so\r\nupdates to public npm modules may take some minutes to show up in our registry.\r\nThe public database is read-only, so do not try to publish to it. In the event\r\nof failure to resolve a module, the server will failover to the official npm\r\nservice. This service is SSL-secured and monitored by pingdom.\r\n\r\n### Issues?\r\nIf you have questions, comments, or notice issues with this service, please file\r\nan issue here: <https://github.com/norfolkjs/npmjs.us>.\r\n\r\n\r\n1CTs5sGpaXNhvjL5B4my1EmHLoK5TPqrPT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
